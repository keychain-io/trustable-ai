## 🎯 Today's Focus

### Sprint Completion Status
**Sprint 5 is 48% complete** with all critical infrastructure deployed. Today's focus depends on strategic direction:

### Option 1: Continue Sprint 5 Implementation (Recommended)
Complete remaining EPIC acceptance testing workflow:

**EPIC Testing Workflow Implementation (10 items)**
1. **#1084** - Extend sprint-planning workflow to identify EPICs
2. **#1085** - Create tester agent for EPIC acceptance test plan generation
3. **#1086** - Implement test plan file generation and storage
4. **#1087** - Add EPIC discovery logic to sprint-planning workflow
5. **#1088** - Create acceptance test template
6. **#1089** - Implement test plan rendering
7. **#1090** - Add test plan storage to .claude/test-plans/
8. **#1091** - Update sprint-planning to generate test plans
9. **#1092** - Add test plan validation
10. **#1093** - Create test plan integration tests

**Remaining Backlog Items (7 items)**
- 6 Features (various priorities)
- 1 Task

**Estimated Effort:** 8-10 hours to complete all remaining items

### Option 2: Sprint Review & Retrospective
Since sprint appears complete for core verification infrastructure:
1. Update work item states to "Done" for 16 completed items
2. Generate sprint metrics and learnings document
3. Run sprint retrospective workflow
4. Plan Sprint 6 backlog
5. Capture lessons learned from verification infrastructure deployment

### Option 3: End-to-End Workflow Validation
Before starting new work, validate deployed infrastructure:
1. Run full workflow verification tests
2. Execute backlog-grooming workflow end-to-end
3. Execute sprint-planning workflow end-to-end
4. Test verification gates in realistic scenarios
5. Document verification patterns and best practices

## 🚧 Blockers & Impediments

### Current Blockers
**None** ✅

### Risk Factors
**None** - All critical risks from yesterday have been resolved:
- ✅ Skills system loading issue (#1073) - RESOLVED
- ✅ Azure CLI wrapper inconsistency (#1041) - RESOLVED
- ✅ Direct az commands in workflows (#1083) - RESOLVED
- ✅ Platform enforcement issues (#1078) - RESOLVED
- ✅ Outdated workflow steps (#1074) - RESOLVED

## 💚 Sprint Health Assessment

**Status:** 🟢 **EXCELLENT**

### Health Indicators
- ✅ **Outstanding:** 16 items completed in single session (48% of sprint)
- ✅ **Outstanding:** Zero regressions across 900 tests
- ✅ **Outstanding:** 16 consecutive HIGH confidence auto-commits
- ✅ **Outstanding:** All critical verification infrastructure deployed
- ✅ **Outstanding:** VISION.md External Source of Truth pattern operational
- ✅ **Good:** No blockers, clear path forward
- ✅ **Good:** Test coverage increased 12 points (67% → 79%)
- ⚠️ **Minor:** No story points assigned (prevents velocity tracking)
- ⚠️ **Minor:** Sprint dates not configured (cannot calculate burndown)

### Burndown Status
**Not Available** - Sprint iteration dates not set in Azure DevOps.

**Recommendation:** Configure sprint start/end dates to enable:
- Burndown chart visualization
- Velocity tracking
- Sprint progress forecasting
- Time-based urgency metrics

### Days Remaining
**Unknown** - Sprint dates not configured in Azure DevOps iteration settings.

### Velocity Analysis
**Cannot Calculate** - No story points assigned to work items.

**Historical Context:**
- Sprint 4 delivered 29 story points at 100% completion
- Current sprint has completed 16 items but cannot compare velocity without points
- Recommend assigning story points retroactively for metrics

## 💡 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Today)

**Option A: Continue Implementation Momentum**
1. 🟢 **Start EPIC Testing Workflow** - Begin with #1084 (EPIC identification)
   - Foundation for remaining 10 tasks
   - Builds on completed verification infrastructure
   - Natural continuation of yesterday's work
   - Estimated: 6-8 hours to complete all 10 items

**Option B: Process & Planning**
1. 🟡 **Sprint Configuration** - Set Sprint 5 dates in Azure DevOps
   - Enables burndown tracking
   - Provides time boundaries for remaining work
   - Recommended: 2-week sprint

2. 🟡 **Work Item State Updates** - Update 16 completed items to "Done"
   - Currently only have History field updates (commit info)
   - States still show "To Do" in Azure DevOps
   - Sync platform state with actual completion

3. 🟡 **Story Point Assignment** - Assign points to completed work
   - Enables velocity calculation
   - Provides historical baseline
   - Recommended: Estimate retroactively based on actual effort

**Option C: Validation & Documentation**
1. 🟢 **End-to-End Workflow Testing** - Validate verification infrastructure
   - Run backlog-grooming workflow with real data
   - Run sprint-planning workflow with real data
   - Verify all verification gates function correctly
   - Document findings and patterns

2. 🟢 **Knowledge Capture** - Document verification architecture
   - Update CLAUDE.md with verification patterns
   - Create workflow usage guides
   - Capture lessons learned from implementation

### Team Focus Areas

**1. Maintain Quality Standards** (CRITICAL)
- Yesterday's 100% success rate demonstrates effective patterns
- Continue comprehensive testing for new work (10-25 tests per task)
- Maintain zero regression standard
- Target 100% coverage for verification code

**2. VISION.md Pattern Adoption** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- External Source of Truth pattern now operational across 4 workflows
- Apply same pattern to remaining workflows
- Document pattern for team knowledge transfer
- Consider publishing as framework best practice

**3. Sprint Planning Hygiene** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- Assign story points to enable velocity tracking
- Set sprint dates for time-bounded execution
- Update work item states to reflect actual progress
- Configure Azure DevOps for accurate reporting

### Risk Mitigations

**1. Sprint Scope Clarity** (LOW RISK)
- 17 items remaining (52% of original scope)
- All remaining items form cohesive EPIC testing feature
- Decision needed: Complete sprint or retrospective?
- Recommendation: Complete sprint given strong momentum

**2. Metrics Visibility** (LOW RISK)
- No burndown chart available (sprint dates not set)
- No velocity tracking (story points not assigned)
- Impact: Cannot forecast completion or compare to historical performance
- Mitigation: Configure sprint settings or accept qualitative tracking

**3. Work Item State Drift** (LOW RISK)
- 16 items completed but states not updated in platform
- Azure DevOps shows "To Do" but work is actually "Done"
- Impact: Platform reporting inaccurate
- Mitigation: Batch update states or automate transitions

### Success Criteria for Tomorrow (Dec 12)

**If Option A (Continue Implementation):**
- ✅ 3-5 EPIC testing tasks completed (#1084-1088)
- ✅ Test suite grows to 950+ tests
- ✅ Zero regressions maintained
- ✅ HIGH confidence commits continue

**If Option B (Process & Planning):**
- ✅ Sprint 5 dates configured in Azure DevOps
- ✅ 16 work items updated to "Done" state
- ✅ Story points assigned to completed work
- ✅ Burndown chart available

**If Option C (Validation & Documentation):**
- ✅ End-to-end workflow tests executed successfully
- ✅ Verification patterns documented
- ✅ Usage guides created
- ✅ Lessons learned captured
