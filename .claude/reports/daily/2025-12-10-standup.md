## 🎯 Today's Focus

Since this is the first day of Sprint 5, the team should focus on:

### Priority 1: Critical Bug Fixes
These bugs are blocking core framework functionality and should be addressed first:

1. **#1073** - Claude skills not loaded
   - **Impact:** Skills system not working, blocking workflow functionality
   - **Recommended Owner:** DevOps/Engineer

2. **#1041** - Azure skills and Azure CLI wrapper tool inconsistency
   - **Impact:** Work tracking integration unreliable
   - **Recommended Owner:** Senior Engineer

3. **#1083** - Workflows use direct az boards commands instead of work tracking skill
   - **Impact:** Platform abstraction broken, violates architecture
   - **Recommended Owner:** Senior Engineer

### Priority 2: Workflow Configuration Issues
4. **#1074** - sprint-planning workflow recommended next steps outdated
   - **Impact:** Poor developer experience, confusion during sprint planning
   - **Recommended Owner:** Scrum Master/Engineer

5. **#1078** - product-intake workflow doesn't enforce work tracking platform
   - **Impact:** Inconsistent adapter selection, potential data issues
   - **Recommended Owner:** Senior Engineer

### Priority 3: New Feature Work
Once critical bugs are resolved, begin EPIC acceptance testing feature:

6. **#1084** - Extend sprint-planning workflow to identify EPICs
7. **#1085** - Create tester agent for EPIC acceptance test plan generation
8. **#1086** - Implement test plan file generation and storage

**Recommended Team Action:** Hold a brief planning session this morning to assign the top 5 bugs and establish WIP limits.

## 🚧 Blockers & Impediments

### Current Blockers
**None reported** - However, potential risks identified:

### ⚠️ Risk Factors
1. **No sprint dates set** - Cannot calculate burndown or track velocity
   - **Action Required:** Product Owner to set sprint start/end dates in Azure DevOps

2. **Skills system not loading (#1073)** - This may block multiple workflow executions
   - **Impact:** High - Core framework functionality affected
   - **Mitigation:** Prioritize this bug for immediate resolution

3. **Platform abstraction violations (#1083)** - Technical debt affecting architecture
   - **Impact:** Medium - Creates maintenance burden, breaks extensibility
   - **Mitigation:** Address after skills loading issue resolved

### Dependency Concerns
- EPIC acceptance testing features (#1080, #1082) depend on:
  - Tester agent creation (#1085)
  - EPIC extraction capability (#1084)
  - Test plan storage implementation (#1086)

  **Recommendation:** Complete foundational tasks (#1084-1086) before tackling parent features.

## 💚 Sprint Health Assessment

**Status:** ⚠️ **AT RISK**

### Health Indicators
- ✅ **Good:** No items blocked, clean slate for sprint start
- ⚠️ **Concern:** No work started, sprint dates not configured
- ⚠️ **Concern:** 7 critical bugs affecting core functionality
- ❌ **Issue:** Cannot calculate burndown without sprint dates

### Burndown Status
**Not Available** - Sprint iteration dates not set in Azure DevOps.

**Days Remaining:** Unknown (sprint dates not configured)

### Velocity Concerns
- **Previous Sprint Data:** Sprint 4 delivered 29 story points at 100% completion
- **Current Trajectory:** Cannot calculate without sprint dates
- **Risk:** Sprint may lack urgency without time boundaries

---

## 💡 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Today)
1. **🔴 Set Sprint Dates** - Product Owner/Scrum Master to configure Sprint 5 iteration in Azure DevOps
   - Without dates, team lacks sprint urgency and burndown tracking

2. **🔴 Fix Skills Loading (#1073)** - Highest priority bug
   - Blocks workflow execution across the framework
   - Assign to most experienced engineer immediately

3. **🟡 Quick Planning Session** - 30 minutes to assign top 5-7 items
   - Get work started to build momentum
   - Establish WIP limits (recommend 2-3 items in progress max)

### Team Focus Areas
1. **Bug Resolution First** - Clear the 7 bugs before new feature work
   - Bugs affect framework reliability and developer experience
   - Features can wait; broken workflows cannot

2. **Architecture Compliance** - Address platform abstraction violations (#1083)
   - Don't let technical debt accumulate
   - Enforce work tracking skill usage across all workflows

3. **EPIC Testing Foundation** - Build infrastructure before features
   - Complete tasks #1084-1086 as a unit
   - Then tackle parent features #1080, #1082

### Risk Mitigations
1. **Skill System Failure (#1073)**
   - Assign backup engineer to investigate in parallel
   - Document root cause for learning capture
   - Consider rollback strategy if fix is complex

2. **No Sprint Dates**
   - Set dates ASAP or convert to Kanban flow
   - Without time boundaries, scope creep is likely

3. **Large Sprint Scope (33 items)**
   - Consider splitting into two sprints
   - Or, establish clear "must have" vs "nice to have" priorities
   - Risk of team burnout with 33 items

### Suggested Priorities (Rank Order)
1. Configure Sprint 5 dates in Azure DevOps
2. Fix #1073 (skills not loading)
3. Fix #1041 (Azure skills inconsistency)
4. Fix #1083 (direct az commands in workflows)
5. Fix #1078 (product-intake platform enforcement)
6. Fix #1074 (sprint-planning outdated steps)
7. Begin EPIC testing foundation (#1084, #1085, #1086)
