## 🚫 Blockers & Issues

### Critical Bugs in Sprint 2 (5 items)
⚠️ **Priority 2 Bugs** (in Sprint 2, need owner assignment):
1. **#1016**: Product-intake workflow missing Bug-specific fields in Azure DevOps
   - Impact: Workflow cannot create bugs properly
   - Status: New (Sprint 2), needs owner

2. **#1017**: trustable-ai init fails to copy skills to .claude/skills
   - Impact: Workflow import errors for new users
   - Status: New (Sprint 2), needs owner
   - Related to #1015 fix area

3. **#1023**: Feature-implementation workflow references undefined /software-developer agent
   - Impact: Workflow execution failures
   - Status: New (Sprint 2), needs owner

4. **#1024**: Agent definitions lack depth and quality compared to gateway originals
   - Impact: Agent effectiveness and user experience
   - Status: New (Sprint 2), needs owner

## 📈 Sprint Health Metrics

### Velocity Indicators
- **Completed in Sprint**: 1 critical bug fix (unplanned)
- **Active Features**: 0 (tasks only - hierarchy needs review)
- **Pending Tasks**: 3 tasks in To Do state
- **Bug Backlog**: 5 bugs (4 high priority, 1 medium)

### ⚠️ Concerns
1. **Work Item Hierarchy**: Sprint contains standalone Tasks instead of Feature → Task hierarchy
   - Current: 3 standalone tasks (#1018, #1019, #1020)
   - Required: Tasks should be children of Features per Scrum Master guidelines

2. **Bug Owner Assignment**: 5 bugs in Sprint 2 need individual owners
   - Recommendation: Assign owners today to ensure completion by sprint end

3. **Sprint End Tomorrow**: Day 4 of 4, need to plan Sprint 2 completion activities

### 🟢 Positive Trends
- ✅ Quick response to critical bug (#1015) - identified, fixed, and released within 24 hours
- ✅ Active product intake - 6 new feature requests triaged
- ✅ Documentation improvements completed

---

## 🎯 Today's Focus Areas

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Assign Bug Owners**: Assign individual owners to Sprint 2 bugs (#1016, #1017, #1021, #1023, #1024)
2. **Sprint 2 Closure Prep**: Review completion criteria for tomorrow
3. **Work Item Hierarchy Cleanup**: Convert standalone tasks to proper Feature → Task structure

### Recommended Priorities
- Address #1017 (skills copy failure) - likely quick win, improves init reliability
- Review #1023 (undefined agent reference) - workflow execution blocker
- Begin Sprint 3 planning activities

---

## 💬 Notes

- Sprint 2 ends tomorrow (Dec 7)
- v1.2.3 successfully released with Windows UTF-8 fix
- Significant product intake activity indicates strong user engagement
- Consider dedicated bug fix sprint or allocation in Sprint 3
